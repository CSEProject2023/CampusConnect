        For students, a resume is a critical document that helps them secure
        internships, part-time jobs, and other career-related opportunities. A
        well-written resume showcases a student's academic achievements,
        extracurricular activities, and relevant work experience, if any. This
        document can demonstrate a student's strengths and potential to
        potential employers, which can help them stand out from other
        applicants. Moreover, it serves as a tool to communicate a student's
        skills, experiences, and achievements that are relevant to the job or
        internship they are applying for. Overall, a well-crafted resume is
        essential for students to effectively market themselves and secure their
        desired job or internship.
